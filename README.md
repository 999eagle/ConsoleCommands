# ConsoleCommands
This is a plugin for Detox adding a few console commands I wanted to have in Terraria.

## Currently available commands
- /tgm or /godmode: Toggles godmode for the player
- /grid: Toggles building grid
- /give <item> <count> (<item2> <count2> ...): Gives items to the player. <item> can be either an id or a name
